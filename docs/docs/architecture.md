# Architecture

evjs is a React framework built around file conventions, explicit source
declarations, a framework graph, a bundler-independent build plan, and one
runtime manifest. The framework-owned route model is file-based: client pages
come from `src/pages`, server file routes come from `src/apis`, and server
middleware is split between framework request middleware in `src/middleware.ts`
and API route middleware in `src/apis/**/middleware.ts`.

```txt
src/pages + src/apis + src/middleware.ts + ev.config.ts
  -> AppGraph
  -> BuildPlan
  -> bundler build
  -> BuildOutput
  -> runtime / shell / deployment adapters
```

## Public Packages

Application code imports config, plugin, build, and deployment APIs through
`@evjs/ev`. File-convention apps also import curated authoring APIs from
`@evjs/ev/page`, `@evjs/ev/request`, and `@evjs/ev/transport`; generated
framework code resolves client/server runtime internals through
`@evjs/ev/internal/*`. `@evjs/client` and `@evjs/server` remain
standalone/manual runtime packages for apps that intentionally own those
surfaces directly. Other packages are tooling, bundler adapters, or shared
contracts for framework packages. When a new capability needs a boundary,
prefer adding a subpath export to the package that owns the behavior before
creating another distributed package.

```txt
@evjs/ev
  composition/control plane for config, plugin lifecycle, file-route
  discovery, dev/build orchestration, framework build types, capability
  validation, deployment helpers, and file-convention authoring subpaths

@evjs/client
  standalone/manual browser runtime core, framework-managed page runtime,
  server-function transport, navigation primitives, and RSC client runtime

@evjs/server
  standalone/manual server runtime core for Hono/fetch apps, server functions,
  route primitives, request context, and SSR/PPR/RSC request handling
```

`@evjs/cli` and `@evjs/create-app` are distribution tooling. Bundler adapters
stay in `@evjs/bundler-utoopack` and `@evjs/bundler-webpack`, and shared
runtime/manifest contracts stay in `@evjs/shared`. `@evjs/ev` decides which
runtime capabilities can be composed in one app through config resolution,
graph analysis, build-plan generation, and manifest validation; the runtime
packages provide the capability primitives.
Programmatic `@evjs/server` APIs such as `createApp()` and `createRoute()` are
runtime primitives. evjs framework builds do not scan them as an alternate route
declaration model; use `src/apis` for framework-managed server routes.

| Role | Packages | Import guidance |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Framework surface | `@evjs/ev` | Use `@evjs/ev` for config/build/plugin/deployment APIs and feature composition; use `@evjs/ev/page`, `@evjs/ev/request`, and `@evjs/ev/transport` in file-convention app source. |
| Standalone runtime APIs | `@evjs/client`, `@evjs/server` | Use these packages only when application source intentionally owns standalone/manual CSR or server runtime primitives. |
| Tooling | `@evjs/cli`, `@evjs/create-app` | Install or execute them; application modules should not import them. |
| Bundler adapters | `@evjs/bundler-utoopack`, `@evjs/bundler-webpack` | `@evjs/cli` owns the default Utoopack adapter. Import an adapter directly only when authoring custom tooling. |
| Shared contracts | `@evjs/shared` | Published so framework packages share manifest/runtime types; app code should not import it directly. |

Published package manifests stay ESM-only and intentionally narrow. Every
distributed package sets `"type": "module"`, publishes with public access and
the MIT license, and whitelists generated output only: `esm` for framework,
runtime, adapter, and contract packages; `dist`/`bin` for `@evjs/cli`; and
`dist`/`templates` for `@evjs/create-app`.

Subpath exports stay explicit and documented; adding a new package export is a
public API decision, not a convenience alias.

Internal `@evjs/*` runtime dependencies are kept explicit. `@evjs/ev` consumes
`@evjs/client`, `@evjs/server`, and shared contracts so file-convention apps can
install one framework package while generated code still reaches the runtime
cores. `@evjs/server` also consumes `@evjs/client` for shared runtime types.
`@evjs/cli` owns the
default Utoopack adapter dependency, and bundler adapters depend on `@evjs/ev`
instead of depending on each other. Internal runtime dependency versions stay
`"*"` in source manifests for workspace development, then release automation
rewrites them to the concrete release version before publishing.

Generated-only `@evjs/ev/internal/client/*` and
`@evjs/ev/internal/server/*` subpaths let framework-emitted route
declarations, page bootstraps, server-function stubs/registrations, and RSC
runtime entries type-check. Application code imports public authoring APIs from
`@evjs/ev/page`, `@evjs/ev/request`, or `@evjs/ev/transport`; it must not
import generated-only internal helpers. Examples include
`@evjs/ev/internal/client/route-types` for generated SPA route declarations,
`@evjs/ev/internal/client/server-functions` for generated `"use server"`
client stubs, `@evjs/ev/internal/server/server-functions` for generated
`"use server"` server registrations, and
`@evjs/ev/internal/client/rsc-runtime` for RSC page bootstraps.

Do not reintroduce legacy split packages such as `@evjs/build-tools`,
`@evjs/manifest`, or `@evjs/router-*`. Build helpers are exported from
`@evjs/ev/build-tools`, and manifest contracts are exported from
`@evjs/shared/manifest`.

Documentation code examples follow the same package boundary: file-convention
application examples import from `@evjs/ev`, `@evjs/ev/page`,
`@evjs/ev/request`, or `@evjs/ev/transport`; standalone runtime examples may
import from `@evjs/client` or `@evjs/server`; adapter examples may import
`@evjs/bundler-utoopack` when demonstrating custom tooling.

## Internal Modules

```txt
@evjs/ev/build-tools
  source analysis, file-route discovery, server-function extraction,
  graph/plan helpers, framework transforms, HTML helpers

@evjs/shared/manifest
  AppGraph, BuildPlan, BuildOutput, and manifest schemas

@evjs/ev generated-only runtime internals
  framework-managed runtime, shell, router-free react-page runtime, transport,
  RSC client runtime, SPA router integration, and generated bootstrap behind
  @evjs/ev/internal/* subpaths backed by @evjs/client and @evjs/server internals

@evjs/bundler-utoopack
  default bundler adapter used by @evjs/cli

@evjs/bundler-webpack
  validation/fallback adapter for SSR/PPR/RSC and dynamic entry/server
  dev plan updates while Utoopack lower-layer APIs catch up
```

`@evjs/ev/build-tools` does not import bundler adapters. Bundler adapters consume `BuildPlan`; they do not rediscover framework semantics from source files after bundling.
The `@evjs/ev/build-tools` subpath is intentionally limited to CLI and bundler
adapter tooling APIs. Low-level module export parsing, server-function ID
hashing, and module-ref helpers stay private to `@evjs/ev`.

  end

```

Builds emit the complete private `BuildOutput` handoff artifact at
`dist/build-output.json`. The public manifest path comes from `output.client`;
the server manifest path comes from `output.server`. Deployment adapters may
embed equivalent runtime data into platform files, so deployed server runtimes
do not have to read `dist/build-output.json` at startup.

TanStack Router is available through the `@evjs/client` standalone CSR surface
for manual browser applications. In framework-managed apps, `@evjs/ev` owns
file-route discovery and generated bootstraps, so page code uses `src/pages`,
page hooks, and navigation helpers instead of constructing router bootstraps
directly. Generated bootstraps use `@evjs/ev/internal/client/*`.

## Runtime Flow

```mermaid

  Server-->>Browser: SSR HTML

  Browser->>Server: GET PPR page route
  Server->>Manifest: match shell and region renderers
  Server->>Server: render/cache internal regions
  Server-->>Browser: PPR HTML in the same route response

  Browser->>Server: GET runtime.server.rsc?page=id
  Server->>Manifest: read RSC renderer and reference manifests
  Server-->>Browser: React Flight stream
```

PPR does not require the browser to fetch region endpoints during initial page
load. The framework server can use either `merge` or `stream` delivery for the
page route. `merge` is the default non-streaming mode and returns the final
server-composed HTML after shell and regions resolve. `stream` sends shell HTML
first, then sends region patches in the same document response. The derived
`runtime.server.ppr` endpoint remains available for direct/debug access and
cache validation.

In a single server process, region resolution is an internal framework call. In
an edge deployment, the same contract can split across layers: the edge can
serve a cached shell and resolve dynamic regions by server-to-server calls to an
internal origin/FaaS endpoint. The browser still sees only the page route:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser
  participant Edge as Edge/CDN
  participant Origin as Internal FaaS / Origin

  Browser->>Edge: GET /campaign
  Edge->>Edge: load cached PPR shell
  Edge->>Edge: read manifest PPR region metadata
  Edge->>Origin: GET /__evjs/ppr/campaign/region_a1b2c3d4e5f6
  Origin->>Origin: render/cache internal region
  Origin-->>Edge: region HTML fragment + cache headers
  Edge->>Edge: apply region cache policy
  alt delivery = merge
    Edge-->>Browser: complete composed HTML
  else delivery = stream
    Edge-->>Browser: shell HTML, then region patch in same response
  end
```

That split means `GET /__evjs/ppr/...` may appear in edge-to-origin logs but not
in browser network logs. The long-term runtime boundary is a replaceable region
resolver: local Node/dev can call the renderer in-process, while edge adapters
can fetch an internal FaaS endpoint without changing the public page protocol.

The preferred PPR authoring model is React `Suspense`. The page component
declares `export const render = "ssr"` plus
`export const prerender = { partial: true, delivery }`. PPR is a prerendering
strategy on top of SSR, not a separate document render mode. In evjs 0.2 this
area remains experimental: runtime postponed/resume for arbitrary Suspense
boundaries is not implemented yet, and the current compatibility splitter only
creates internal region renderers for the limited `Suspense` + direct
`lazy(() => import(...))` shape. Region ids are opaque framework details.

PPR page hydration is page-level `none` in the public manifest. Client
interactivity should be introduced through explicit client islands or
region-level hydration metadata, not by hydrating the whole PPR shell.

RSC uses the same `@evjs/server` boundary for Flight requests. The Flight
endpoint accepts `page=<id>` and an optional `url=<pathname+search>` value; that
`page` id must be a manifest page id using the build-identifier rule. The URL
context must be an absolute same-origin path or HTTP(S) URL and must not include
a hash.
The Webpack validation path uses React Flight client consumption and React
client/server reference manifests; Utoopack still needs equivalent lower-layer
metadata before it can run the same path.

## Configuration Ownership

```txt
routing
  page route source of truth: spa or mpa mode, dir, html, mount point

server.routing
  server file route source of truth: dir, discovered HTTP method modules

entry/html
  manual single app shorthand

pages.*
  explicit independent page output: path, entry/component/app, mount point

server.basePath
  derives framework server runtime paths: fn, ppr, rsc

transport.baseUrl
  browser-to-framework-server base URL shared by framework requests

plugins
  framework and bundler extension points
```

`routing` points to `src/pages` by default. In SPA mode, graph creation turns
the discovered files into one internal TanStack Router app entry. In MPA mode,
the same files become independent page outputs without a client router.

`server.routing` points to `src/apis` by default. A server route file becomes a
route only when it exports uppercase HTTP methods. Framework request middleware
is discovered from `src/middleware.ts` and wraps framework-managed server
requests. API route middleware is discovered by filesystem scope from
`src/apis/**/middleware.ts` and only wraps descendant server file routes. Route
modules do not export middleware and there is no `server.entry` composition
path.

Page modules own path-to-component wiring by filename and rendering metadata
through static exports such as `render`, `hydrate`, `rsc`, and `prerender`.
When graph creation sees SSR, RSC, or partial prerender metadata, it derives the
required server renderers, PPR regions, assets, and manifest output from that
page module.
Full BuildOutput manifests keep those renderer relationships explicit: SSR, SSG, and
RSC document pages resolve through a `page-server` renderer owned by the page id
or by one of that page's route ids. PPR pages resolve through `ppr-shell` and
`ppr-region` entries instead.

`pages.*` remains the explicit lower-level page API. It is useful when a page
does not map cleanly to the `src/pages` file tree. Rendering metadata still
belongs in the referenced page module, not in `ev.config.ts`.

## Server Function Pipeline

```txt
"use server" module
  -> build-tools extraction
  -> client transform creates internal client references
  -> server transform/register path
  -> BuildOutput.server.functions
  -> framework server dispatches POST runtime.server.fn
```

The public config exposes `server.basePath`; the function endpoint is derived from that base path.

RSC `use client` reference extraction preserves these names in
`BuildOutput.rsc`:

- default exports;
- identifier exports;
- class exports;
- same-module aliases;
- namespace re-export names such as `export * as Widgets from "./widgets"`;
- re-exported names, including string-literal aliases.

Type-only exports are ignored. The client reference transform emits internal
bindings with export specifiers, so reserved words and string-literal aliases
stay valid JavaScript.

The RSC manifest rules are strict:

- `BuildOutput.rsc.clientReferences` and `BuildOutput.rsc.serverReferences` use
  the extracted reference id as a trimmed string key.
- Reference ids may contain file paths, URL syntax, `#`, or `:`.
- The value object carries the trimmed `module` and optional trimmed
  `exportName`.
- Reference-only RSC output can omit `BuildOutput.rsc.endpoint`.
- RSC page output cannot omit `BuildOutput.rsc.endpoint`, because Flight
  requests need a concrete endpoint.
- The manifest linker rejects RSC page output when `runtime.server.rsc` is
  missing.

For full BuildOutput manifests, each RSC page renderer reference must resolve
to an `rsc-page` renderer whose `owner.pageId` matches the RSC page id. Public
manifests may omit that server-only renderer metadata.

After ignoring type-only and ambient declarations, a `"use client"` module must
still expose at least one runtime client reference. Bare runtime
`export * from "./widgets"` is rejected because the framework manifest must know
every client reference export name; use explicit named re-exports or a
namespace re-export instead.

Malformed `"use client"` modules are reported during graph analysis with the
file path and parser message before the bundler transform runs.

## Deployment

Deployment adapters consume `BuildOutput`. `@evjs/ev` provides:

- `createDeploymentArtifact(output)` for platform-neutral routing/assets/server metadata;
- `nodeDeploymentAdapter()` for a concrete Node production target that emits
  `dist/deployment.node.json` and `dist/server.mjs`;
- `staticDeploymentAdapter()` for static-host routing metadata and `_redirects`;
- `edgeDeploymentAdapter()` for edge-worker style runtime bootstraps that call the
  framework server bundle and an asset binding.

Platform-specific adapters should derive their routing, framework endpoint, SSR,
PPR, RSC, and asset metadata from `BuildOutput` instead of reading bundler stats.
Build-pipeline adapters receive that object in memory; post-build tools can read
`dist/build-output.json`.
Full BuildOutput manifests retain source modules and server renderer references;
public/browser manifests keep the same routing and asset shape but redact those
server-only fields, so client-side validation treats them as optional.

The deployment model is capability-driven:

```txt
static-only
  CSR / MPA client entries / SSG / assets

unified node
  static assets + framework endpoints + SSR/PPR/RSC + server functions/routes

unified edge worker
  asset binding + edge-compatible framework server bundle

edge + origin/FaaS split
  edge caches assets/shells
  origin/FaaS resolves functions, routes, SSR/RSC, and PPR regions
```

Adapters should classify `BuildOutput` first, then emit platform routes. Static
hosting must not claim support for SSR, PPR, RSC, server functions, or server
routes unless a server-capable runtime is attached.

## Dev Updates

Framework-level file-convention changes are handled separately from normal HMR:

```txt
config / page route / server file-route / middleware convention change
  -> recreate AppGraph
  -> recreate BuildPlan
  -> diff BuildPlan
  -> if BuildPlan changes:
       bundlerDevController.updatePlan(update, nextGraph)
  -> if graph-only:
       refresh active graph + dependency watchers
```

The default Utoopack adapter applies HTML-only plan updates by relinking
framework output from existing build stats. It still reports a clear unsupported
error for dynamic entry and server renderer updates until Utoopack exposes the
lower-layer API. The webpack adapter can apply those broader updates in-process
for architecture validation. Style and asset edits remain on the bundler HMR
path. Server-function and server-route implementation edits usually keep the
same `BuildPlan`; in that case the framework refreshes graph metadata and watch
inputs, while the bundler's normal server watch emits the updated code.

Graph analysis reads page route modules, server file route modules, middleware
convention modules, and static import closures to discover server functions,
page metadata, and RSC references. Static import closure discovery parses
modules, so it follows ordinary imports, re-exports, and valid string-literal
import aliases. Literal dynamic imports are also tracked when they point at
project-relative modules. Dev watches the page route directory, server route
directory, explicit graph roots, and files that already contain framework
markers. Configured page components are explicit graph roots because their
static `render`, `hydrate`, `rsc`, and `prerender` exports affect framework
planning. Ordinary component, app entry, and style edits stay on the bundler
HMR path unless those modules declare framework markers.
